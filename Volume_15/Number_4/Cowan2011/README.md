Source Code
-----------

The shaders (vertex and fragment) were implemented using the OpenGL Shading Language.  The source code is provided below.

* [Vertex Shader](vertexShader.glsl)
* [Fragment Shader](fragmentShader.glsl)
* [CPU-based code](cpuCode.cpp) (code to process the output from the shader on the CPU.)
